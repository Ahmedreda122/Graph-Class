# Graph Class

This C++ Graph Class provides functionalities for solving graph problems using an adjacency list representation. It includes implementations of various graph algorithms for traversal, shortest path finding, minimum spanning tree, and more.

## Features

1. **Graph Representation**: Supports both matrix and adjacency list representations of graphs.
2. **Breadth First Search (BFS)**: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.
3. **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Performs depth-first traversal of the graph recursively.
4. **Shortest Path**: Computes the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices using BFS.
5. **Dijkstra Algorithm**: Finds the shortest paths from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
6. **Prim's Algorithm**: Computes the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.
7. **DFS Iterative**: Performs depth-first traversal of the graph iteratively.
8. **Connected Components**: Finds the connected components of an undirected graph.

There's Two File: The First for Zero-Based Representation and The Second for One-Based
